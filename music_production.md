## Mixing

There's 2 aspects to the stereo field besides panning to consider: perceived distance from the listener (or depth) and stereo width.

I create depth in my mix using the predelay on my reverb sends. At 15-20ms or more, it will sound like the sound is coming from very close to you, because your brain thinks that its hearing the sound before it hears the reflections off the walls of the imaginary space your track is set in. At 0ms, it sounds like the sound is coming from far away because the sound is coming in at the same time as its reflections. Try it out and you'll see what I mean. If you still have trouble explaining it, I'll draw it out. I usually create 3 reverb sends, one each for close, medium, and far sounds, and send each sound to a different reverb based on where I want to place it in the mix.

Stereo width is also an easy way to create space in a mix, and help give some elements or sounds definition. I normally use the Haas effect or the Precedence effect to create stereo width in my mixes. Just use a stereo delay (I use ableton's "Simple Delay") with the dry/wet at 100% wet, feedback at 0, the time for whichever side I want the sound to "come from" at 1ms, and the other side set to anywhere from 8 to 30ms, depending on how much width I want.

By combining these with panning, we can create a 2 dimensional field in front of the listener where we can virtually "map out" where things are placed in the stereo field.

Now think about a rock band and how each member is physically laid out on a stage:

Singer: up front, in the middle Lead Guitar: up front, off to one side Rhythm guitar: opposite side of the lead guitar, also up front Bassist: usually somewhat center near the drummer, behind the singer Drums: center, behind everything else, with cymbals having a bit of variance in their panning from center

This is essentially how I lay out my tracks. I also try and give each element its own unique "coordinate" in that field, so that it feels like a real space in which the track "lives".

Your kick and your SUB bass should really be centered. It also helps to have the snare centered, or close to it. These should also pretty much always be mono as well.

after that, its pretty much up to you. I generally do a shape almost like a tree, with my kick and sub as my trunk, and my other elements branching out from that. Higher frequencies can normally be panned out farther than mids or low mids while retaining clarity.

But wait, we also have stereo width!

Width is really just making it sound like there is more than one of something in different places in your mix, so lets consider what SHOULDN'T have width. Percussion and drums for example aren't generally used in multiples of the same instrument in an orchestra or band (you don't see 3 timpany players in an orchestra), so generally, I keep my percussion to a single voice, and don't really add any widening.I've found it tends to take away from the transient (or click/hit) of the percussion. Vocals also generally sound better as a single voice, as they are sung by a single person. If they're already sung by multiple people (like a chorus), they probably already have some width to them.

I tend to have a few layers to my lead, including one thats more centered and louder, and one or more that are a little wider, possibly changing octaves as well. I'll usually pan them just slightly to one side or the other (the vast majority of my panning tends to be between 1 and 10 to either side in Ableton). Chords can go either way based on the instrument for me. Something old school like a rhodes or an organ will generally stay as-is for me. Supersaws, on the other hand, I will give a ton of voices and spread them way out, but thats just the nature of supersaws.

When making more complex bass sounds, it usually helps to have a few different layers to create a richer sound in the stereo field. You'll still wanna keep your sub mono, but if you arrange your layers so that your higher layers have a bit of width to them, it will really make those growls come through in a mix.
