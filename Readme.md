Add the shebang line (#!/bin/bash) at the very top.
Use chmod u+x scriptname to make the script executable (where scriptname is the name of your script).
Place the script under /usr/local/bin folder.
Note: I suggest placing it under /usr/local/bin because most likely that path will be already added to your PATH variable.
Run the script using just its name, scriptname.
