First remove the picture: gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri ''

Then apply RGB value, for example: gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background primary-color 'rgb(66, 81, 100)'

This will give it a nice blue/grey color, almost identical as we had it in Color options before they removed it.
